Welcome to the course!
Dear Students,
Welcome to what promises to be a unique and personally meaningful semester! Classes begin in just one week, and I wanted to share three essential insights that will set you up for success from day one.
This Course Is About Your Real Life, Not Abstract Theory
Unlike traditional ethics courses, you won't be memorizing philosophical theories or solving hypothetical moral puzzles. Instead, you'll be developing a practical toolkit for navigating the ethical complexity you actually face—when loyalty to a friend conflicts with professional responsibilities, or when environmental concerns clash with career pressures.
No prior coursework in philosophy or ethics is required. This course is designed for students at all levels and across all disciplines. You will need:
Willingness to engage in honest self-reflection
Ability to identify a genuine ethical dilemma from your own experience
Openness to exploring your own decision-making patterns
Commitment to sustained engagement with complex ideas over the semester"*
Key insight: Choose a dilemma you genuinely care about with real stakes. The success of your entire semester depends on selecting something that matters to you personally and can sustain deep exploration.
AI Is Your Thinking Partner, Not Your Shortcut
You'll be working with AI throughout this course, but not to generate answers for you. Think of AI as a collaborative partner that helps you explore ethical complexity in ways that would be difficult alone—challenging your assumptions, pushing your reasoning, and helping you see your dilemma from multiple angles.
Essential practice: Create "checkpoints" every 10-15 minutes of AI conversation. Save these summaries as files so you can resume work across sessions without losing context. This isn't just good organization—it's how you'll document your evolving thinking process for your final self-assessment.
You're Building an Algorithm for Ethical Decision-Making
We're treating ethics as an evolving algorithm—a decision-making process that guides how you navigate challenges when multiple values compete for your attention. You'll discover the heuristics (mental shortcuts) you already use, then systematically examine them against formal philosophical frameworks.
What this means: Instead of traditional tests and grades, you'll demonstrate your learning through self-assessment, making a case for your own intellectual growth with evidence from your work throughout the semester.
Staying Connected in an Online Course
I know online asynchronous courses can feel isolating, and it's remarkably easy to fall behind when there aren't regular class meetings to keep you on track. I've designed this course specifically to address these challenges:
You're not learning alone: You'll be reading course assignments in a shared, collaborative browser app called Perusall, where you will be asked to share your thoughts about the text, and where you can read the musings of your classmates. Additionally, around the middle of the semester, you will be invited to share some of your work in a shared Google folder and examine the work others submit. I am calling this a Gallery Walk, much like what it would be like if we were to stage our work in a museum or art gallery for others to consider.
Structured guidance: Every major task includes detailed AI prompts that guide you step-by-step through the process. You're never left wondering "what do I do next?"
Questions?
This approach may feel unfamiliar, but you're not alone. The course includes structured AI prompts to guide you through every phase, peer podcasts to hear how others wrestle with similar challenges, and my support when you need it. I've taught enough online courses to know where students typically struggle, and I've built support systems to catch you before you fall through the cracks.
I'm excited to see how your ethical reasoning develops this semester as you build tools you can actually use when things get complicated.
Oh, and by the way...
My name is Clayn Lambert. I am the department chair for Business and Support Services in the College of Technology. I have been teaching in the Technical General Education program since August of 2002. My background started in English and teaching development writing courses, but over the years, I have expanded my repertoire into the social sciences. I created TGE 1257 in 2013 and have overseen much of the development of the course over the years. 

P.S. If you're feeling uncertain about whether this course is right for you, that's normal. The most meaningful learning often happens when we're working with genuine complexity rather than easy answers. Trust the process—and reach out if you need support along the way.
Course Grading Policy
Overview: Self-Assessment Approach
This course uses self-assessment rather than traditional point-based grading. There are no quizzes, tests, rubrics, or point totals. Instead, you will demonstrate your learning through sustained philosophical work documented across seven modules, then make an evidence-based case for your final grade.

Why Self-Assessment?
Traditional grading encourages students to figure out what the instructor wants. But ethical thinking requires you to grapple with genuine uncertainty, make discoveries you can defend, and develop your own intellectual voice. Self-assessment supports authentic engagement with philosophical complexity rather than performance for points.

How Grading Works
Throughout the Semester (Parts 0-6):
Complete all module activities and document your work in your shared Google Drive folder
Engage authentically with readings, AI conversations, peer interactions, and philosophical exploration
Build an evidence trail that demonstrates your intellectual journey
At Semester's End (Part 7):
Review your complete body of work from Parts 0-6
Write a self-assessment (1-2 pages) that includes:
Your learning journey narrative (2-3 paragraphs)
3-5 specific evidence examples from your work with explanations of what they demonstrate
Your proposed grade with justification
Schedule a collaborative conversation (15-20 minutes) with Dr. Lambert to discuss your self-assessment
Final Grade Determination: Your final grade will be determined collaboratively based on:
Your self-assessment and proposed grade
The evidence you provide from your documented work
Our conversation about your learning

Making Your Case: Guidance Questions
Rather than prescribing what each letter grade "means," you'll make an argument for your grade based on evidence of your learning. Different students will make different cases—there's no single formula.
To make a compelling argument, you should be able to:
Point to specific evidence from your documented work (not general claims like "I worked hard")
Tell the story of your learning showing where you started and how your thinking evolved
Acknowledge both strengths and limitations honestly
Connect your evidence to the intellectual work we've done all semester
Questions to guide your grade proposal:
About Engagement:
Can you show moments where you genuinely wrestled with complexity rather than seeking easy answers?
Where did you lean into discomfort rather than away from it?
Did you explore your dilemma with genuine curiosity or go through the motions?
About Growth:
What did you understand at the end that you couldn't have articulated at the beginning?
Where did your thinking become more sophisticated or nuanced?
Can you trace specific shifts in how you understand your ethical reasoning?
About Honesty:
Did you document your actual thinking, including contradictions and unresolved tensions?
Can you point to places where you were honest about gaps between your ideals and behavior?
Did you acknowledge what remains difficult rather than forcing tidy conclusions?
About Integration:
How did philosophical frameworks change how you see your dilemma?
Can you show evidence of working with philosophical concepts, not just about them?
Where did frameworks illuminate patterns you were using unconsciously?
About Intellectual Risk:
When did you push beyond your comfort zone?
Where did you challenge your own assumptions?
Can you show evidence of exploration that surprised you?
About Documentation:
Is your evidence trail complete enough to make your case?
Do your AI transcripts show genuine thinking or surface-level exchanges?
Can someone else follow your intellectual journey through your work?
The collaborative conversation:
Our conversation isn't an interrogation—it's a collaborative discussion about what your evidence shows. I might ask:
"Can you walk me through this piece of evidence and what it demonstrates?"
"What surprised you most about your own learning?"
"Where do you feel you took intellectual risks?"
"What would you do differently if you were starting the course now?"
"How does this evidence support the grade you're proposing?"
Your grade will emerge from the strength of your argument and the evidence you provide, not from whether you hit predetermined benchmarks.

Common Misconceptions About Self-Assessment
❌ "I completed all the work" ≠ automatic high grade (completion is baseline; depth of engagement matters)
❌ "I resolved my dilemma" ≠ success (some dilemmas don't resolve; understanding why is learning)
❌ "I struggled" ≠ failure (struggle with evidence of genuine engagement is valuable)
❌ "I worked really hard" ≠ sufficient justification (what did that work produce in terms of learning?)
✅ "Here's where my thinking shifted, here's the evidence, here's what it demonstrates" = strong argument

Important Notes
Completion Requirements:
All seven modules must be completed to receive a passing grade
The collaborative conversation (Part 7) is required and serves as the course's final exam
Missing documentation makes it impossible to assess learning
Honesty Matters More Than Perfection:
You won't be penalized for acknowledging struggles, unresolved tensions, or patterns you're not proud of
Authentic self-reflection is valued more than presenting an idealized version of your learning
The goal is understanding your ethical complexity, not solving it perfectly
Grade Proposals:
Your proposed grade is taken seriously but is not automatically accepted
Our collaborative conversation may result in adjustments based on evidence discussion
Be prepared to defend your grade with specific examples from your work
If you're uncertain about your grade after reviewing your work, schedule office hours before the final conversation
Academic Integrity:
All work must be your own authentic thinking
AI is used as a thinking partner to help you think, not to generate your thoughts for you
Plagiarism or fabricated evidence will result in course failure

Questions About Grading?
If you have questions about the self-assessment approach, what constitutes strong evidence, or how to make your case effectively, please ask early in the semester. Office hours are available for grading discussions throughout the course.
Communications and Feedback
Communication, Feedback, and Support
Email
Send course emails to [your email] with subject line: "TGE-Ethics-[Section]: [Topic]"
I respond within 24 hours on business days (Monday-Friday, 8am-5pm). Use professional format: greeting, clear message, your name.
How Feedback Works
Your Google Drive folder contains all your work—drafts, AI transcripts, revisions. I can see it in real-time, so I monitor your progress weekly rather than grading batches of assignments.
AI gives you immediate feedback on grammar, organization, clarity, and revision suggestions throughout your writing process.
I provide human judgment on things AI can't assess: Is your project authentic? Are you actually learning? Can you assess your own work? Are you stuck?
When You'll Hear From Me
I'll reach out if:
You haven't progressed in 2+ weeks
Your work shows confusion or concerns
You've missed a required checkpoint
Required Checkpoints
Part 3 Check-In: Schedule an appointment during my office hour after you complete Part 3 or another time that works for you.
Part 6 Deeper Exploration Conversation: Schedule an appointment during my office hour after you complete Part 6 or another time that works for you.
Self-Assessment: During the Final Exam session, you will schedule an appointment to discuss the grade you suggest in your self-assessment and the evidence provided; during that meeting, we will finalize your grade for the course.
Office Hours: 
Office Location: RFC 284
Office Phone: (208) 282-3257
In-Office Hours: T @ 9 am, Th @ 1 pm; also by appointment or by phone (208) 282-3257

My Commitment
I'll monitor your progress, respond to emails within 24 hours (business days), and reach out if I'm concerned. But you're adults—I won't chase you if you choose not to engage. I'm here to support your success, but you have to show up for it.
What This Means for You:
You're not working in isolation. I'm watching your progress and will reach out if I'm concerned. But you also have agency—you can work at your own pace and request help whenever you need it. The shared Drive folder means we're in this together throughout the semester, not just at grading deadlines.

Why This Variety Matters:
Different ways of demonstrating learning: Written analysis, visual representation, conversational exploration, peer engagement
Authentic to philosophical practice: Philosophers write, debate, diagram, reflect, and engage in dialogue
Accommodates diverse strengths: Students can excel through different modalities
Prevents gaming: No single "type" of performance determines success
Appropriateness for Course Level (1000-Level General Education)
 
Developmentally Appropriate:
Starts with familiar territory (own life, own thinking) rather than abstract philosophical concepts
Scaffolds complexity gradually:
Parts 0-1: Identify and describe
Parts 2-3: Analyze patterns
Part 4: Strategic planning
Part 5: Apply and discover
Parts 6-7: Synthesize and reflect
Provides extensive support:
AI as thinking partner throughout
Structured prompts for all major activities
Model questions rather than expecting students to generate frameworks independently
Readings introduce concepts that students then discover in their own thinking
Doesn't require prior philosophy knowledge:
Archaeological approach means discovering concepts in own patterns rather than learning theory first
Perusall annotations help students collectively make sense of readings
Multiple attempts/explorations allow for learning through iteration
Emphasizes process over product:
Documentation valued over polished final products
Honest struggle and unresolved tensions are legitimate outcomes
Growth mindset embedded in assessment approach
Rigorous but Accessible:
Sustained engagement with complex ideas (10 philosophical frameworks over semester)
Requires sophisticated thinking (analyzing own reasoning, integrating multiple frameworks, constructing evidence-based arguments)
But doesn't assume expertise: Students work with concepts at their own level, guided by structured support
Authentic assessment: Rather than testing whether students can define "categorical imperative," asks whether they can recognize where Kantian thinking already appears in their own reasoning
Formative vs. Summative Balance
Formative (Low-Stakes, Learning-Focused):
Perusall annotations (practice analytical reading)
AI conversations (think-out-loud exploration)
Gallery Walk (learn from peers)
Part 6 synthesis (review and integration)
Summative (Evidence-Building, Evaluative):
Complete documentation trail (Parts 0-6 collectively)
Self-Assessment + Collaborative Conversation (Part 7)



Alignment with Course Philosophy
The assessment sequence and variety directly support the archaeological approach:
You can't excavate what you haven't documented → Continuous documentation throughout
Discovery happens through conversation → AI-facilitated interviews and peer engagement
Complexity requires multiple representations → Visual, written, conversational modalities
Learning is non-linear → Students choose framework sequence; unresolved tensions are valid
Growth requires honest self-assessment → Culminating reflection on entire journey

AI-Generated Feedback (Immediate, Throughout Semester)


Where:
All AI-facilitated activities (Parts 0-7)
What You Receive:
Probing questions that reveal gaps in your thinking
Summaries that mirror your ideas back for examination
Challenges to assumptions you're making
Prompts to go deeper or get more specific
Timing: Immediate during each AI conversation
How to Use It:
If AI repeatedly asks for clarification, you may be staying too abstract
If AI summary doesn't match your intent, you may need to articulate more clearly
If conversation feels surface-level, push yourself to engage more substantively
Instructor Feedback on Documentation (Formative, Ongoing)


Where:
Your shared Google Drive folder
What You Receive:
Comments on documents indicating areas needing clarification, expansion, or revision
Questions highlighting where evidence is thin or claims need support
Recognition of particularly strong analytical moments
Gentle redirects if you're off-track
Timing:
Periodic throughout semester (Dr. Lambert reviews folders on rolling basis)
More frequent feedback available upon request during office hours
Intensive review before Part 7 self-assessment
How to Use It:
Check your folder regularly for comments
Respond to questions and revise as needed (documentation is living, not static)
Schedule office hours if you receive feedback you don't understand
Self-Monitoring Checkpoints (Built into Course Structure)


Devil's Advocate (Part 1):
Purpose: Stress-test your dilemma before building semester's work on it
Feedback: Reveals whether dilemma is substantial enough for sustained analysis
Action: Refine or choose different dilemma if needed
Heuristics Review (Part 2):
Purpose: Ensure you've identified actual patterns, not aspirational ones
Feedback: Gaps between what you claim and what evidence shows
Action: Return to AI interview to probe deeper if patterns seem shallow
Conflict Map Working Document (Part 3):
Purpose: Create referenceable summary of tensions
Feedback: Can you articulate tensions clearly enough to use them all semester?
Action: Revise until tensions are concrete and well-defined
Gallery Walk Reflection (Part 5):
Purpose: Compare your analytical depth to peers
Feedback: Are you excavating as deeply as others? Differently?
Action: Adjust approach for remaining framework explorations
Part 6 Journey Review:
Purpose: Assess how understanding has evolved
Feedback: Can you show clear growth from Parts 0-6?
Action: Identify gaps in documentation or reflection before Part 7

What If I'm Struggling?
Early Intervention Is Key:
Don't wait until Part 7 to discover your documentation is insufficient
If something isn't working (dilemma, approach, understanding), address it early
Office hours exist specifically to help you course-correct
Common Struggles and Solutions:
"I don't know if I'm doing this right" → Schedule office hours to review your work; compare your depth to Gallery Walk peers
"My AI conversations feel shallow" → Push yourself to ask "why" more; share more context; explore discomfort
"I'm behind on framework explorations" → Create catch-up schedule; consider which frameworks can be briefer vs. deeper
"I can't tell if my thinking has changed" → Reread your Part 0-1 work; note places where you'd now say something different
Course Materials
Academic integrity means giving credit where it's due. Even though all course materials are Open Educational Resources (free and openly licensed), we still cite them properly. Why? Because citing isn't about copyright—it's about intellectual honesty. Authors deserve recognition for their ideas and work, regardless of whether they charge for access. Just as you'll document your thinking through AI transcripts, this course models proper attribution by citing all readings and showing you how to acknowledge sources—including AI conversations—in your own work.
Here is a bibliography of all materials used in this course, using APA 7th Edition guidelines:

Example: Anthropic. (2024). Claude (Sonnet 3.5) [Large language model]. https://claude.ai
For in-text citations, use: (Anthropic, 2024). When submitting transcripts, include the full conversation as an appendix and cite specific exchanges by referencing the appendix location. Always document the complete date of your interaction within your transcript submission.
Data Privacy and Technology Safety
 
Data Privacy and Technology Use
This course uses several technologies that involve your personal data and intellectual work. Understanding how to protect your privacy while engaging authentically with course content is important.
Your Rights and Responsibilities
You have the right to understand what happens to the data you create in this course. You have the responsibility to make informed decisions about what personal information you share in course activities.
General Principle: Be thoughtful about sharing sensitive personal information in any online environment, even when that environment is designed for educational purposes.

What You Should Know:
Data Retention:
Most AI platforms store your conversation history unless you explicitly use privacy modes or delete conversations
Some platforms use conversations to improve their models (though educational accounts often have protections)
Conversation data may be retained even after you stop using the service
What This Means for Your Course Work:
Your AI conversations will contain personal reflections on real ethical dilemmas from your life
Consider what level of detail you're comfortable having potentially stored by the AI platform
When discussing your dilemma, you can use pseudonyms for other people involved (e.g., "my supervisor," "a colleague") rather than real names
Avoid including identifying information about third parties (full names, specific company names, detailed location information) unless you're comfortable with that data being potentially retained
Privacy-Protective Practices:
Check your chosen platform's privacy settings:
Many AI tools offer "privacy mode" or options to prevent conversation storage
Educational or paid accounts often have stronger privacy protections than free accounts
Review privacy settings when you first set up your account
Be strategic about what you share:
Your dilemma should be authentic, but you can describe situations without identifying specific individuals
Example: Instead of "My manager Sarah Thompson at ABC Corporation asked me to..." write "My manager asked me to..."
Focus on the ethical complexity, not identifying details
Understand that your instructor will see your work:
You'll submit complete AI conversation transcripts to your Google Drive folder
Only Dr. Lambert will have access to these transcripts
These are part of your academic record and will be treated confidentially
Resources for comparing AI platform privacy:
[You would insert a link here to a comparison resource, or I can help you create one]
If you have concerns about privacy with your chosen AI tool, contact Dr. Lambert to discuss alternatives
Perusall: Collaborative Annotation
Who can see your annotations:
All students enrolled in TGE 1257 Spring 2026
Dr. Lambert (instructor)
Perusall platform administrators (per their privacy policy)
What this means:
Your annotations are part of a learning community—they're meant to be visible to classmates
Annotations become part of your academic record
Other students may reference or respond to your comments
Privacy tips:
You're annotating published philosophical texts, not sharing personal diaries
When connecting texts to personal experience, you can be authentic without oversharing identifying details
If you're uncomfortable with a comment you've posted, you can edit or delete it before the assignment deadline
Google Drive: Shared Folders
Who can access your folder:
Only you and Dr. Lambert
Google (as the platform provider, per their institutional privacy agreement with ISU)
What's shared:
All documents you create in your TGE 1257 shared folder
This includes AI transcripts, your conflict map, framework explorations, and self-assessment
Privacy protections:
Your folder is NOT visible to other students
ISU uses Google Workspace for Education, which has enhanced privacy protections beyond consumer Google accounts
Your work will not be used for commercial purposes or advertising
Best practices:
Keep all course work in your designated TGE 1257 folder for appropriate privacy settings
Don't share your folder with anyone other than Dr. Lambert
If you need to discuss folder access issues, contact Dr. Lambert

Course Communications
Communicate with me via email, not through Canvas messaging.
Make sure emails have your class number and section in the subject line, along with a brief cue to the subject (e.g. “1101-A2 Missing for Tech Expo”). In addition, include an opening salutation, a brief message—including any action desired/expected, and a closing salutation (including your name). Emails without these elements may not receive a response.
Emails sent during business hours (8–5 M–F) will receive responses as soon as possible (my presence in other classes or meetings may postpone these somewhat). Emails sent after hours will generally receive responses the next business morning— although urgent requests (as determined by me from the content of your message) may prompt earlier response.
Should you contact me in person, during class, about a need or concern—and we come to some agreement about that— I ask that you email me afterward (as promptly as possible) to remind me for our mutual benefit.
Course Technical Expectations
In order to successfully complete this course, you will need to be able to do the following:
Use a mouse or other input device
Navigate within the Moodle learning management system
Use email with attachments
Create and submit files in commonly used word processing program formats
Copy and paste text within a document and from one file to another
Download and install software if necessary (such as the Firefox internet browser)
Navigate a web page
Upload assignments using a browse function
If you are unsure or unable to perform one or more of these tasks, it is critical that you contact me immediately, so I can arrange training and support for you. Failure to meet these expectations will significantly hamper your ability to complete this course.
General Education Objectives
Recognize and describe humanistic, historical, or artistic works within problems and patterns of the human experience. (Not covered in this course)
Distinguish and apply terminologies, methodologies, processes, epistemologies, and traditions specific to the discipline(s).
Perceive and understand formal, conceptual, and technical elements specific to the discipline.
Analyze, evaluate, and interpret texts, objects, events, or ideas in their cultural, intellectual or historical contexts.
Interpret artistic and/or humanistic works through the creation of art or performance. (Not covered in this course)
Develop critical perspectives or arguments about the subject matter, grounded in evidence-based analysis.
Demonstrate self-reflection, intellectual elasticity, widened perspective, and respect for diverse viewpoints.
General Assignment Expectations
All activities, unless specifically directed otherwise, should be typed in a business font, such as Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman, Calibri, etc. with a font size of 12.
All activities, unless specifically directed otherwise, should be submitted through Canvas in their appropriate assignment link. If you submit an assignment in the wrong place, I will try to inform you. It is up to you to correct any incorrectly submitted assignments.
One document per assignment; do not submit multiple assignments in one document. I will not look for, nor will I correct or accept, additional assignments submitted this way.
Proper spelling and grammar are expected on all submissions, as if they were being considered for business correspondence.
Spelling and grammar are grounds for determining a submission does not meet expectations.
All submissions should use complete sentence format. Incomplete sentences are grounds for determining a submission does not meet expectations.
Each assignment contains a specific list of activities or questions. Review of the submission will focus on whether the responses accurately address these activities or questions.
Disability Services
Idaho State University is committed to providing equal opportunity in education for all students. If you have a diagnosed disability or if you believe you have a disability (physical, learning, hearing, vision, psychiatric) that might require reasonable accommodation in this course, please contact the Disability Services Center, Rendezvous Building, Room 125 (282-3599) or on the web at http://www.isu.edu/ada4isuLinks to an external site..

State Law, Academic Freedom, and Course Expectations
Under Idaho Code § 67-5909D (effective July 1, 2025), courses that are "derived from or promote" certain concepts associated with critical theory or DEI may fall under additional state scrutiny. Importantly, Idaho Code § 67-5909D also affirms that it does not "limit the free discussion of ideas in a classroom setting," allowing us to maintain a learning environment where we can explore a wide range of perspectives thoughtfully and respectfully.
Like all courses at Idaho State University, this course is grounded in the values expressed by the Idaho State Board of Education:
“Membership in the academic community imposes on administrators, faculty members, other institutional employees, and students an obligation to respect the dignity of others, to acknowledge the right of others to express differing opinions, and to foster and defend intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and instruction, and free expression on and off the campus of an institution." SBOE Policy III.B.
Your learning is at the forefront of my approach in this class. In designing this course, I have carefully selected readings, activities, and/or assignments to challenge and support your growth. You are encouraged to engage critically with all course materials—questioning arguments, considering multiple viewpoints, and forming your own reasoned conclusions. While you may encounter perspectives different from your own, you will never be asked to adopt any particular belief or ideology.
As we begin our work together, I encourage you to review the syllabus and other course materials carefully. They are designed to help you understand the course structure, expectations, and how we will build a respectful, engaging learning community this semester. If you do not wish to take this course for any reason, please contact your Academic Advisor (AskanAdvisor@isu.edu) to find alternatives that may be available to you. Please be sure to review the academic calendar for important deadlines related to course withdrawal.
Student Success
Success in this course depends heavily on your personal health and well-being. Recognize that stress is an expected part of the college experience, and it often can be compounded by unexpected setbacks or life changes outside the classroom. Your other instructors and I strongly encourage you to reframe challenges as an unavoidable pathway to success. Reflect on your role in taking care of yourself throughout the term, before the demands of exams and projects reach their peak. Please feel free to reach out to me about any difficulty you may be having that may impact your performance in this course or campus life as soon as it occurs and before it becomes too overwhelming. In addition to your academic advisor, I strongly encourage you to contact the many other support services on campus that stand ready to assist you.
